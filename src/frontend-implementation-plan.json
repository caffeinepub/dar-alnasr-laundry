        "When navigating to the same category and item in the UI, the price text content at XPath `/html[1]/body[1]/div[1]/div[1]/div[1]/main[1]/div[1]/div[4]/div[1]/div[1]/span[1]` shows AED 4.00 (as formatted by the existing formatter) and no other item prices change.",
        "The change is implemented by updating the corresponding item `price : Nat` value in `backend/main.mo` so the UI reflects the updated value through normal data flow (no hardcoded UI overrides)."
